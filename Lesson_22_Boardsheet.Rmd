A convenient model for OPS as a function of age is a quadratic function:

\[OPS = A + B(Age - 30) + C(Age - 30)^2\]

What are some good reasons to use the quadratic model?

What are some bad reasons to use the quadratic model?
\vspace{1in}

Why do we subtract 30 from $Age$ in the model?

Based on this model, find an expression for the peak age.

In the quadratic model, explain what $C$ tells us about a player's trajectory.
